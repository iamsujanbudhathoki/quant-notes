# Comprehensive Quantitative Finance Key Concepts

Quantitative finance employs a wide range of technical terms and concepts rooted in mathematics, statistics, economics, and computer science. These terms are foundational for understanding models, strategies, and tools in the field.

## 1. Financial Instruments and Markets
- **Asset**: Anything with economic value, e.g., stocks, bonds, derivatives.  
- **Equity**: Ownership in a company, typically represented by stocks.  
- **Fixed Income**: Securities like bonds that pay a fixed return.  
- **Derivative**: Financial contract whose value depends on an underlying asset (e.g., options, futures, swaps).  
- **Option**: Contract granting the right (not obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a set price.  
- **Future**: Contract to buy/sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price.  
- **Swap**: Agreement to exchange cash flows, e.g., interest rate swaps, currency swaps.  
- **Underlying**: The asset or variable on which a derivative’s value is based.  
- **Spot Price**: Current market price of an asset.  
- **Forward Price**: Agreed-upon price for future delivery of an asset.  
- **Volatility**: Measure of price fluctuations of an asset over time.  
- **Liquidity**: Ease of buying/selling an asset without impacting its price.  
- **Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences in different markets for risk-free profit.

## 2. Risk & Return Metrics
- **Expected Return**: Anticipated return on an investment, often a weighted average of possible outcomes.  
- **Risk Premium**: Extra return expected for taking on additional risk.  
- **Alpha**: Excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark.  
- **Beta**: Sensitivity of an asset’s returns to market movements.  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return = (return - risk-free rate)/standard deviation.  
- **Sortino Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return focusing on downside risk.  
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Maximum potential loss over a period at a given confidence level.  
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Expected loss exceeding VaR.  
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of dispersion of returns.  
- **Skewness**: Asymmetry of return distribution.  
- **Kurtosis**: "Tailedness" of a return distribution.  
- **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained.  
- **Tracking Error**: Deviation from benchmark.  
- **Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough decline.  
- **Risk-Neutral Pricing**: Valuation assuming investors are indifferent to risk.

- **Covariance / Correlation**: Measures of co-movement between asset returns.  
- **Diversification**: Reducing risk by investing in a variety of assets.  
- **Hedging / Hedge Ratio**: Strategy to offset potential losses, proportion of asset hedged.  
- **Portfolio Beta**: Weighted average of individual asset betas in a portfolio.  
- **Rebalancing**: Adjusting portfolio weights to maintain target allocation.
