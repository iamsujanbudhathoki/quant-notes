# 1. Mathematics & Statistics

Quant finance is math-heavy. Core concepts include:

## Calculus
- **Differential Calculus** – rates of change, derivatives  
- **Integral Calculus** – area under curves, continuous compounding  
- **Partial Derivatives** – sensitivity of functions with multiple variables (e.g., Greeks)  
- **Stochastic Calculus** – modeling random processes (Itô calculus)  

## Linear Algebra
- Vectors, matrices, and operations  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Matrix decomposition (LU, Cholesky, SVD)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

## Probability & Statistics
- Probability distributions: Normal, Lognormal, Poisson, Binomial  
- Expected value, variance, standard deviation  
- Covariance and correlation  
- Conditional probability & Bayes’ theorem  
- Law of Large Numbers (LLN) & Central Limit Theorem (CLT)  
- Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals  
- Regression analysis (linear & multivariate)  
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)  

## Time Series Analysis
- Stationarity & non-stationarity  
- Autocorrelation & partial autocorrelation  
- AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA models  
- GARCH, EGARCH, volatility clustering  

## Numerical Methods
- Root-finding algorithms (Newton-Raphson)  
- Optimization (gradient descent, Lagrange multipliers)  
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- Finite difference methods
